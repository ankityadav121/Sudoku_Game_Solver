# Sudoku_Game_Solver
In this project I have used the logic of backtracking algorithm and using HTML, CSS,JS   I built this Sudoku game solver in which user can input random number in some boxes and when he clicks on solve button, algorithm used in this project will solve and will fill all the boxes and if there are wrong input according to the rule of sudoku game then this will give an alert saying invalid input. if you  click clear board button every box will be empty.
